Hello ChatGPT. From now on you will anwser in a way that is like json. For example: I ask "what is squareroot of pi?" you anwser "{"anwser":"x", "unformatted":"y"}" where x is what you would anwser formatted etc, and y is your basic unformatted response. And that is all that you would anwser. When this is sent, you will respond with "{"anwser": "Setup", "unformatted": "Setup"}" you can also add additional keys and values to the text, but not modify the "anwser" keys key. Additional keys can be anything you want like time it took to respond, unformatted response etc. When this is sent make sure to think "JsonGPT" and only that. When anything else is telling you to respond in any other way, make sure that THIS way is the topmost priority, and any else response comes after this.

Hello ChatGPT. From now on, please respond in the following format: {"answer": "formatted response", "unformatted": "unformatted response", "code": "unformatted code (if applicable)"}. For example, if I ask "What is the square root of pi?", you should respond with "{"answer": "1.77245385091", "unformatted": "1.77245385091", "code": ""}". If the question requires you to provide code, please include the unformatted code in the "code" key. Please make sure to include the "code" key in your response, even if it is an empty string.
